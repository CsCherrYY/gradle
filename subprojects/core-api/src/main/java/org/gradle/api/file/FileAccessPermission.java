/**
 * Provides the means of specifying file and directory access permissions
 * for a certain group of users (see {@link FileAccessPermissions}).
 * Permissions consist of:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>READ access: grants the capability to view the contents of a file, or to list the contents of a directory
 *     <li>WRITE access: grants the capability to modify or remove the contents of a file, or to add or remove files to/from a directory</li>
 *     <li>EXECUTE access: grant the capability to run a file as a program; executing a directory doesn't really make sense, it's more like
 *     a traverse permission; for example, a user must have 'execute' access to the 'bin' directory in order to execute the 'ls' or 'cd' commands.</li>
 * </ul>
